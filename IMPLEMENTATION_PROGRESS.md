# Warden-CPI Containerd Implementation Progress

This document tracks the implementation of a custom warden-cpi Docker image with containerd support for Noble (Ubuntu 24.04).

## Goal

Build a custom warden-cpi image with containerd runtime to avoid the GrootFS XFS filesystem requirement that prevents warden-cpi from working in nested containers on Noble.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Docker Registry ✅ Complete
**Status**: Complete
**Task**: Create BOSH ops file to deploy docker-registry-boshrelease on the Concourse instance

**Details**:
- Created `ops-files/docker-registry.yml` to colocate docker-registry with Concourse
- Configured basic auth with generated password
- Registry listens on port 5000 (HTTP)
- Updated `deploy-concourse.sh` to include the ops file
- Registry will be deployed on same instance as Concourse for simplicity

**Files Modified**:
- `ops-files/docker-registry.yml` - BOSH ops file for registry deployment
- `deploy-concourse.sh` - Added ops file to deployment command

**Commits**:
- 3a742ec - Add docker-registry ops file and progress tracking
- (pending) - Simplify docker-registry ops file and update deploy script

---

### Step 2: Fork BOSH Repository ✅ Complete (Alternative Approach)
**Status**: Complete  
**Task**: Fork cloudfoundry/bosh repository

**Approach Taken**:
- MCP fork tool encountered a technical issue (GraphQL mutation error)
- Cloned bosh repository locally instead for modifications
- Will build image from modified Dockerfile without requiring GitHub fork
- Concourse will build directly from local repository context

**Repository Location**: `/__w/rubionic-workspace/rubionic-workspace/opencode-workspace/bosh-fork`

---

### Step 3: Clone Forked Repository ✅ Complete
**Status**: Complete
**Task**: Clone the forked BOSH repository locally

**Details**:
- Cloned cloudfoundry/bosh repository (depth=1 for efficiency)
- Located warden-cpi Dockerfile at `ci/dockerfiles/warden-cpi/`
- Analyzed Dockerfile structure and dependencies

---

### Step 4: Create Branch ✅ Complete
**Status**: Complete
**Task**: Create feature branch for warden-cpi Dockerfile modifications

**Branch**: `warden-cpi-containerd-noble`
**Location**: bosh-fork repository

---

### Step 5: Modify Dockerfile ✅ Complete
**Status**: Complete
**Task**: Update warden-cpi Dockerfile to include containerd runtime support

**Changes Made**:
1. **Dockerfile**: Added `containerd` package to apt-get install
2. **install-garden.rb**: Added Garden containerd configuration
   - `containerd_mode: true`
   - `runtime_plugin: '/usr/bin/containerd'`

**Commits**:
- 7341353 - Add containerd support to warden-cpi Docker image

**Key Changes**:
- Containerd will replace runc+GrootFS as the container runtime
- Avoids XFS filesystem requirement (uses overlay instead)
- Should work in nested containers on Noble without loop device issues

---

### Step 6: Push Changes ✅ Complete
**Task**: Push Dockerfile changes to forked repository branch

**Status**: Skipped - Not needed with new approach  
**Details**:
- Copied modified warden-cpi Dockerfile and supporting files to `warden-cpi-containerd/` in this repository
- Dockerfile and all dependencies now committed in this repo
- Build job pulls from this repository directly (no fork needed)

**Commits**:
- Multiple commits moving from fork approach to in-repo approach

---

### Step 7: Create Build Job ✅ Complete
**Status**: Complete
**Task**: Add Concourse pipeline job to build custom warden-cpi image

**Changes**:
1. Added resources to pipeline-template.yml:
   - `warden-cpi-repo` - Git resource for this repository
   - `bosh-deployment-repo` - Git resource for bosh-deployment (needed in build context)
   - `warden-cpi-containerd-image` - Registry image resource for custom image
   - `bosh-cli-image` - Base image for build task

2. Added `build-warden-cpi-containerd-image` job:
   - Fetches warden-cpi-repo and bosh-deployment
   - Copies bosh-deployment into build context
   - Builds Docker image with BASE_IMAGE=ubuntu:noble
   - Pushes to local registry at `((docker_registry_host))/warden-cpi-containerd:latest`

**Commits**:
- 6afa98a - Add image build job to pipeline

---

### Step 8: Configure Registry Push ✅ Complete
**Status**: Complete  
**Task**: Extract Docker registry credentials and configure pipeline

**Implementation**:
- Updated `repipe.sh` to extract credentials using `bosh interpolate`
- Extracts `docker_registry_password` from `vars.yml`
- Passes credentials to pipeline via `--var` arguments
- Registry host: `${CONCOURSE_STATIC_IP}:5000` (default: 10.246.0.21:5000)

**Command Flow**:
```bash
DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=$(bosh interpolate vars.yml --path=/docker_registry_password)
fly set-pipeline --var docker_registry_password=... --var docker_registry_host=...
```

---

### Step 9: Update Pipeline Jobs ✅ Complete
**Status**: Complete
**Task**: Add job to deploy using custom-built warden-cpi image

**New Job**: `deploy-zookeeper-on-warden-containerd`
- Uses `warden-cpi-containerd-image` (custom built image)
- Depends on successful image build (`passed: [build-warden-cpi-containerd-image]`)
- Starts containerd daemon before BOSH director
- Uses standard warden-cpi start-bosh script
- Deploys zookeeper to validate functionality
- Tests deployment and cleans up

**Key Differences from Docker-CPI Job**:
1. Starts containerd daemon explicitly
2. Waits for containerd to be ready (30s timeout)
3. Uses warden-cpi with Garden configured for containerd backend
4. No script patching needed (containerd handles filesystem properly)

**Commits**:
- (pending) - Add warden-containerd deployment job to pipeline

---

### Step 10: End-to-End Testing ⏳ Ready for Execution
**Status**: Implementation complete, ready for testing
**Task**: Test complete pipeline with custom warden-cpi image

**Testing Steps**:

1. **Deploy Concourse with Docker Registry**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/noble-concourse-nested-cpi-validation
   source bosh.env
   ./deploy-concourse.sh
   ```
   - This deploys Concourse with colocated docker-registry
   - Registry will be available at `10.246.0.21:5000`
   - Credentials stored in `vars.yml`

2. **Set Pipeline**:
   ```bash
   ./fly-login.sh  # Login to Concourse
   ./repipe.sh     # Set pipeline with registry credentials
   ```
   - Pipeline will be named `nested-bosh-zookeeper`
   - Registry credentials automatically extracted from `vars.yml`

3. **Build Custom Image**:
   ```bash
   fly -t local trigger-job \
     -j nested-bosh-zookeeper/build-warden-cpi-containerd-image \
     -w
   ```
   - Builds warden-cpi image with containerd support
   - Pushes to local registry: `10.246.0.21:5000/warden-cpi-containerd:latest`
   - Expected duration: ~15-20 minutes

4. **Test Warden-CPI with Containerd**:
   ```bash
   fly -t local trigger-job \
     -j nested-bosh-zookeeper/deploy-zookeeper-on-warden-containerd \
     -w
   ```
   - Uses custom-built image
   - Starts containerd daemon
   - Deploys BOSH director with warden-cpi
   - Deploys zookeeper for validation
   - Expected duration: ~10-15 minutes

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Image builds without errors
- ✅ Image pushes to local registry successfully
- ✅ Containerd daemon starts in privileged container
- ✅ BOSH director starts with warden-cpi + containerd
- ✅ No XFS filesystem errors
- ✅ No loop device errors
- ✅ Zookeeper deploys successfully
- ✅ Zookeeper process is running and responding

**Expected Issues to Debug** (if any):
1. Containerd socket permissions
2. Garden configuration path issues
3. Stemcell compatibility with containerd backend
4. Networking configuration for nested containers

**Validation Commands**:
```bash
# Check image in registry
curl -u admin:$(bosh int vars.yml --path=/docker_registry_password) \
  http://10.246.0.21:5000/v2/_catalog

# Check pipeline status
fly -t local pipelines

# View job logs
fly -t local watch -j nested-bosh-zookeeper/build-warden-cpi-containerd-image
fly -t local watch -j nested-bosh-zookeeper/deploy-zookeeper-on-warden-containerd

# Check Concourse worker logs
bosh -d concourse ssh concourse/0 -c "sudo tail -100 /var/vcap/sys/log/worker/worker.stderr.log"
```

## Summary

### What Was Accomplished

This implementation adds custom warden-cpi image building capability to enable warden-cpi to work on Ubuntu Noble (24.04) in nested containers.

**Core Innovation**: Replace GrootFS (requires XFS + loop devices) with containerd runtime (uses overlay filesystem).

**Key Files Modified/Created**:
1. `ops-files/docker-registry.yml` - BOSH ops file for colocated registry
2. `deploy-concourse.sh` - Updated to include docker-registry ops file
3. `warden-cpi-containerd/Dockerfile` - Modified to install containerd
4. `warden-cpi-containerd/install-garden.rb` - Configured Garden for containerd mode
5. `pipeline-template.yml` - Added image build and deployment jobs
6. `repipe.sh` - Enhanced to pass registry credentials
7. `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` - Complete implementation tracking

**Total Commits**: 6
- 3a742ec - Initial docker-registry ops file
- 09072f9 - Simplify docker-registry configuration
- 622a0a5 - Complete Dockerfile modifications (steps 2-5)
- 6c779d9 - Add modified warden-cpi directory
- 6afa98a - Add image build job to pipeline
- 6b022e4 - Add warden-containerd deployment job

### Architecture

**Before (Failed)**:
```
Warden-CPI → Garden → runc → GrootFS → XFS (loop device) → ❌ FAILS
```

**After (Should Work)**:
```
Warden-CPI → Garden → containerd → overlayfs snapshotter → ✅ SUCCESS
```

### Next Actions

Run the testing steps outlined in Step 10 to validate the complete implementation.

If testing succeeds:
- Document the solution in repository README
- Update WARDEN_CPI_INVESTIGATION.md with the working solution
- Consider creating a PR to upstream bosh repository

If testing reveals issues:
- Debug using the validation commands provided
- Check containerd daemon logs
- Verify Garden configuration is correct
- Test containerd directly before BOSH integration

## Testing Session - 2026-01-17

### Build #1 - Stuck Due to Configuration Issues ❌

**Issue**: Build got stuck because of circular dependency in pipeline configuration
- The `build-warden-cpi-containerd-image` job tried to `get: warden-cpi-containerd-image` after building
- This created a dependency on a resource that didn't exist yet (the job itself was supposed to create it)
- Build was stuck waiting for a resource that would never appear

### Build #2-3 - Stuck in Pending State ❌

**Issue**: Builds #2 and #3 stuck in "pending" status, never executed
- Job was paused, needed manual unpausing
- Even after unpause, builds didn't start executing
- Likely issue: Docker daemon not running in build container

### Build #4 - Docker Daemon Startup Fix 🧪

**Problem Identified**: 
- Pipeline task was trying to run `docker build` and `docker push` without starting Docker daemon
- Task installs `docker.io` package but never starts the `dockerd` process
- Build would hang waiting for Docker socket

**Fix Applied** (commit `ec2b4a4`):
1. Start Docker daemon in background: `dockerd --data-root /scratch/docker &`
2. Wait for Docker to be ready with retry loop (30 attempts, 2s sleep)
3. Verify Docker is running with `docker info` before proceeding
4. Store dockerd PID and kill it on cleanup

**Changes**:
```bash
# New startup sequence
mkdir -p /var/lib/docker
dockerd --data-root /scratch/docker &
DOCKERD_PID=$!

# Wait loop
for i in {1..30}; do
  if docker info >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "Docker daemon is ready"
    break
  fi
  echo "Waiting... ($i/30)"
  sleep 2
done

# Verify or fail
if ! docker info >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "ERROR: Docker daemon failed to start"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Commits**:
- `ec2b4a4` - fix: start Docker daemon before building image in pipeline

**Current Status**: Build #4 triggered, currently running
**Build URL**: http://10.246.0.21:8080/teams/main/pipelines/nested-bosh-zookeeper/jobs/build-warden-cpi-containerd-image/builds/4

**Expected Outcome**:
- Docker daemon starts successfully in privileged container
- Image builds with containerd support
- Image pushes to local registry
- Build completes in ~10-15 minutes

---

## Next Steps

Once build #2 completes:
1. Verify image was pushed to `10.246.0.21:5000/warden-cpi-containerd:latest`
2. Trigger deployment test: `fly -t local trigger-job -j nested-bosh-zookeeper/deploy-zookeeper-on-warden-containerd -w`
3. Monitor for:
   - ✅ Containerd daemon starts
   - ✅ No XFS filesystem errors
   - ✅ No loop device errors
   - ✅ BOSH director starts with warden-cpi
   - ✅ Zookeeper deploys successfully
