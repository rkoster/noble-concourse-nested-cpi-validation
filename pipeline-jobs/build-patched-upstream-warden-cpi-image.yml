  #! NOTE: Patching happens in deploy-zookeeper-on-upstream-warden task via start-bosh modifications
  #! This job is disabled - patches are applied at deployment time instead of build time
  #! REASON: Registry-image resources fetched with 'get:' don't produce image.tar files (only PUT operations do)
  #! SOLUTION: Apply patches directly in task scripts before running /usr/local/bin/start-bosh
